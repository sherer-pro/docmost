## Language rules for source comments and tests

To keep terminology and maintenance consistent across the monorepo:

- Write all source code comments in English (including inline comments, block comments, JSDoc, and TSDoc).
- Write all test names and test descriptions in English (`describe`, `it`, and similar test-case labels).
- Keep domain terminology consistent in security- and collaboration-related areas (for example: `auth`, `security`, `workspace`, `member`).

These rules apply to changes in `apps/server`, `apps/client`, `packages/editor-ext`, and related tests.
